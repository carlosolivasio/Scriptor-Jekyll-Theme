# Flag 1

ok so lets start with the obvious
```netdiscover```

as we don't know the machine ip

following up with the nmap scan

interesting so we have nfs open
lets check if there are any folders to share

![](images/ijctf_boot2root/3.png)

So now the process was very simple the box had 2 nic one to use for NAT and other for host-only adapter
So we need to configure host-only adapter ip according to the ip specified to ***Fool the box*** as the challenge name suggests

A useful [guide](https://www.tecmint.com/network-between-guest-vm-and-host-virtualbox/) I found on the internet
I did not use the 2 nics but i should have :(

Anyways using mount command we mount the folder and read the flag1
I am attaching the screenshot of the same file from inside the box i wanted to prevent the unnecesary pain of changing adapters

# Flag 2

This was the flag that suprised me a the most 
trying to login as **restricted**

As the name suggest and shown below its a restricted shell

![](images/ijctf_boot2root/5.png)


after try all the commands I know on linux i read this [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/multiple-methods-to-bypass-restricted-shell/) which turned out to be very useful

I got a normal shell as shown below and the README.txt file was very hard for me to guess as the I couldn't use ```ls``` in madeit directory 
anyways got it after 2-3 hours of brainfuck

# Flag 3
This was one of the main flag that made me go crazy
I got a lot of help from the admin on this
I ran ***linPEAS*** but got nothing 
Then the author told me to use pspy64 
this turned out to be tool that looked for hidden cronjobs 
and it showed thatf **final.sh** was being run as root

![](images/ijctf_boot2root/7.png)

And since final.sh was root only read-write I could do nothing
Once again the great admin came to my rescue :)
He told me to see permissions of ross's home directory
so it seems that **files** directory had ross as the group so we could modify it 
this means that we can make a new final.sh with same path and revshell in it to get the root shell

![](images/ijctf_boot2root/8.png)

We got the root flag as well atlast :)))))

***Note:I got flag 4 after the ctf was over***

# Flag 4
**NOTE**: Stabilise the shell before doing anything

the hint was about forensics tool;
what can be the tools with disk image
volatility --> NOOOO
testdisk --> YES
 
SEE the following images to see the steps I followed to get the final flag!!
